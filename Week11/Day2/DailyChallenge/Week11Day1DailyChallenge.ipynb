        "# Machine Learning Summary / Importance: Machine learning allows us to train computers on specific data. Once trained, the model can apply what it has learned to new data, which makes it valuable for predicting future behavior and/or making decisions. While not data analysts may use machine learning tools regularly, having these skills will provide the analyst with a broader skillset. For those working in the technology industry or in an innovation lab, they can use these skills.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Urban Traffic: We can use machine learning to analyze traffic data to find peak traffic hours and help decide the best times for road construction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Security and Crime Prevention: Machine learning can be used to spot patterns and support rules-based targeting for terrorism and serious criminal activity by learning from past data and trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Language Learning: Machine learning can improve how and where we learn new languages by personalizing lessons and adapting to each learner’s progress. Duolinguo is increaslingly doing this.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Machine Learning Types and Scenarios for Application:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Supervised: We use historical, categorized data with results to train the model ahead of new test data. For example, we can use loan applications to to predict whether the likelihood of future loan default.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Unsupervised Learning: We train the model on non-labeled data to find patterns or groupings on its own. For example, we can group population groups into segments for marketing activities based on customer shopping behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reinforcement Learning:Here, the model learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. For example, we can train a robot to find the shortest path through a maze.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Describe the process of developing a machine learning model. Focus on three main stages: Feature Selection, Model Selection, and Model Evaluation.\n",

        "#Model Development Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Selection (choose useful data)  →  Model Selection (pick appropriate model) →  Model Evaluation (confirm performance)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Feature Selection: Identify and choose the most useful data features that affect the outcome. This step reduces noise and improves accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Model Selection: Pick the right algorithm (e.g., classification, regression, clustering) that best fits the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Model Evaluation: Test the model using metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score) to measure how well it performs and adjust if needed."
