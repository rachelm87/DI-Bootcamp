#Part 1 - Quizz
# What is a class?
    ## A defined data type that includes local methods / properties, for
    # object-oriented programming. Unlike functions, classes contain 
    # both data (variables) called properties and methods (functions defined inside a class).
#What is an instance?
    ##A specific object created from a class. 
    # Example: If Dog is the class, dog1 is an instance.# 
#What is encapsulation? 
    ##Encapsulation restricts access to methods and variables to prevent us from
    # directly modifying the data. We mark this by using single underscore (protected/internal) 
    # or double underscore (protected).
#What is abstraction?
    #hiding of information or abstracting away information and giving access to only whatâ€™s necessary.
#What is inheritance?
    #when a class takes properties of another class; improves the reuse of existing code. 
#What is multiple inheritance?
    #when a class inherits from more than one parent class; 
    # the order of the parent class in a class definition will decide what is inherited. 
#What is polymorphism?
    #It provides a standard interface for multiple forms or data types (i.e. different or related classes use the same names for their functions). 
#What is method resolution order or MRO?
    ##he order in which Python looks through classes to find a method or attribute.
