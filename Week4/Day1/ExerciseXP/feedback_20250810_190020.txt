suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file should be separated from the UI logic in `anagrams.py` as instructed.
- Error handling for file I/O (e.g., file not found) is missing in `__init__`.
- The `get_anagrams` method has a performance bottleneck;  consider using a more efficient data structure for faster lookups (like a set or dictionary).
- The UI in `anagrams.py` is completely missing.  The instructions clearly state to create a separate file for UI interactions.
- Add more robust input validation in the (missing) UI to handle various edge cases more effectively.

suggestions for improvement:
- Improve error handling for file I/O operations in `AnagramChecker`'s `__init__` method.  Handle potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions.
- The `get_anagrams` method could be optimized for performance, especially with large word lists. Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures.
- Add more comprehensive input validation in `anagrams.py`. For example, check for empty strings.
- Add docstrings to methods in both files for better readability and maintainability.
- Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `confirming` in `anagrams.py`.
