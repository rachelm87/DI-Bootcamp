suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `find_oldest_cat` function prints the result instead of returning it.  It should return the oldest `Cat` object as specified in the instructions, then the calling code should print the details.
- In Exercise 2, the `barking` and `jumping` methods should be renamed to `bark` and `jump` for better consistency with Python naming conventions.
- Exercise 3's `Song` class lacks a method to retrieve or set the song title. The instructions don't explicitly require it, but it would be a valuable addition for completeness.
- In Exercise 4,  add error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) to make the code more robust.  For example, what happens if `sell_animal` is called with an animal not in the zoo? Consider adding a more informative message in such cases.
