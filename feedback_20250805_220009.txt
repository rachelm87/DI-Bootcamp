suggestions for improvement:
- In `Currency.__repr__`, the conditional statement to append 's' can be simplified using f-string formatting directly.
- The error handling in `__add__` and `__iadd__` could be improved by providing more informative error messages, specifying the incompatible currencies.
- In Exercise 3, the `print` statement inside the loop is unnecessary; it prints the string multiple times during its construction. Move it outside the loop.
- The Exercise 5 solution doesn't explicitly display the time remaining, only the number of days and seconds. Enhance it to show a more user-friendly representation of the time left (e.g., years, months, days, hours, minutes).
- Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions to improve readability and understanding. 
- Exercise 2 is missing the `func.py` file, which is essential to make it executable. The correctness score is penalized due to the missing file.
