suggestions for improvement:
- For exercise 1, consider adding more detailed comments explaining each step of the calculator creation.
- In exercise 2, it is better to explicitly close workbooks when operations are completed to free resources and prevent potential corruption. The code could be modified to ensure the workbook is always closed, even if an exception occurs.
- In exercise 3, add more comprehensive error handling, such as checking if the file exists before attempting to open it and handling potential exceptions during file writing.
- For exercise 4, consider generating a more complex plot with customization.
- Use more descriptive variable names for better readability in all exercises.
- Colab specific code can be removed to produce more portable code.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the core requirements of each exercise, including creating an Excel calculator, identifying out-of-stock plants, filtering and writing data, and generating a sales report with a visualization. However, some improvements could be made for error handling and code style. The submission directly addresses the tasks outlined in the chapter content, demonstrating a solid understanding of the openpyxl and pandas libraries.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear variable names and comments explaining the main steps. However, there is room for improvement in terms of adding more detailed comments and using more descriptive variable names.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the given tasks, but could be improved by optimizing file I/O operations and using more efficient data structures where appropriate.
- security: The code does not appear to have any major security vulnerabilities, as it does not involve user input or external data sources. However, it is always a good practice to sanitize data and validate inputs to prevent potential injection attacks.
