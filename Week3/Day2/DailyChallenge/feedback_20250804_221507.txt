suggestions for improvement:
- Fix typo in `first_page()` method:  `self.current.idx` should be `self.current_idx`.
- Add more robust error handling for invalid input types in the `__init__` method (e.g., checking if `items` is actually a list and `page_size` is a positive integer).
- Consider adding a method to allow adding or removing items dynamically after initialization, maintaining page structure.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code implements the `Pagination` class with the specified methods (`__init__`, `get_visible_items`, `go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, `previous_page`, `__str__`).  It accurately handles pagination logic, list slicing, and error handling (ValueError) as described in the chapter content. The minor typo does not significantly impact functionality. The test cases mostly align with the requirements.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow. Method names are descriptive.  However, a small typo (`self.current.idx`) slightly detracts from readability.  Adding more comprehensive input validation would improve it further.
- performance: The algorithm used for pagination and list slicing is efficient.  The code's performance is unlikely to become a bottleneck unless handling extraordinarily large datasets.
- security: The code includes a `ValueError` exception to handle attempts to access out-of-bounds pages, thus preventing potential errors or crashes. No obvious security vulnerabilities are present.
