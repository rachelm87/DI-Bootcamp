#EXERCISE 1: RANDOM SENTENCE GENERATOR

#step 1 - read this file
dir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)) #will search directory for file
print('dir path: ', dir_path)

file_path = os.path.join(dir_path, 'words.txt') #define it for the function

#function created to read this delightful file

        file_content = f.read()

        random_sentence = []
        for i in range(length):

            random_sentence.append(word)
        format_sentence = ' '.join(random_sentence).lower()
    return(format_sentence) #don't use print 

print(get_words_from_file(file_path)) #you need the file_path so it doesn't call the function â€” it just prints out the function object itself.

#step 2 - create main function

        exit()
    number = int(message)    #okay its a digit, now let's convert to a number
    if number >20 or number <2: #is it within range? 
        print(f'Number is not within range.')
        exit()
    
    your_sentence = get_words_from_file(file_path, number) 
    #finally, we can create teh sentence!
    return(f'You created a new sentence with {number} words: {your_sentence} !')
